### Using Danger

We have an internal danger bot, [ArtsyDanger](https://github.com/ArtsyDanger). This bot is _only_ for closed source projects. If you are going to move your project to be open, then you will need to use a different account. We use the [ArtsyMobile](https://github.com/ArtsyMobile) one at the minute. 

### Adding Danger to Your Internal Project

* Start a new private browser session, log in with ArtsyDanger. See 1Password for the credentials.
* Create a [new Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) for your project. Give it the whole `repo` scope.
* Start going through the [Getting Started Guide](http://danger.systems/guides/getting_started.html).
