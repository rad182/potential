# Web Practice Reading List

A reading list that is useful for onboarding to the web practice technologies.

### Firstly it's important to know the language well.

* [JavaScript the Good Parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQVTIJBZook)
* [Coffeescript Docs](http://coffeescript.org/)

### Next it's important to know Node.js.

* [Node offcial website](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Original node.js presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztspvPYybIY) (this was when Ryan was learning the art of public speaking so don't feel the need to stick through the whole thing)
* [Beginner Tutorial](http://www.nodebeginner.org/)
* [Neat overview article](http://www.toptal.com/nodejs/why-the-hell-would-i-use-node-js)

### Get familiar with what Force talks to -- our JSON HTTP API (api.artsy.net)

Simply put our API is a Ruby powered web server the serves up our data in JSON form.

* [Learn REST](http://rest.elkstein.org/)
* [Grape a Ruby framework that powers our API](https://github.com/intridea/grape)

### Get to know some of the popular tools Force is built on.

* Popular Node framework: [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
* Popular front-end framework: [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/)
* A templating language that we use to write HTML: [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/)
* A stylesheet language we use to write CSS: [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/)
* Unit testing framework: [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/)

### We do something quite unique and bleeding edge at Artsy that's being coined as "isomorphic javascript".

* [AirBnB blog post explaining isomorphic Javascript](http://nerds.airbnb.com/isomorphic-javascript-future-web-apps/) and [similar slides](http://www.slideshare.net/spikebrehm/a-28174727)
* [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)â€”The node tool we use to share modules between Node & the browser

### Finally, read up on our open source boilerplate which is just a light-weight combination of the above things.

* [Project website](http://ezeljs.com/)
* [Blog post introducing it](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2013/11/30/rendering-on-the-server-and-client-in-node-dot-js/)

Good luck, and please ask any questions in the [#web Slack channel](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/web/).
