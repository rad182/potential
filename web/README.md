### Our Key Technologies

#### Coffeescript

[Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) is just Javascript with a nicer syntax that attempts to expose [The Good Parts](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742).

#### Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) brings Javascript (and to-JS languages like Coffeescript) to the server-side.

#### Ezel

[Ezel](https://github.com/artsy/ezel) is a combination of tools and patterns Artsy released as a boilerplate project generator. It combines [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) in a way that makes it easy to do ["Isomorphic Javascript"](http://nerds.airbnb.com/isomorphic-javascript-future-web-apps/)-ey things.
