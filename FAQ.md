## How to set up a new shared service account
* The it@artsymail.com mailbox is used to set up many shared service accounts. To avoid missing important account notifications, _all_ such accounts should set up forwarding filters from the account's domain to an individual who can be responsible for account changes, billing errors, etc.
* E.g., for an account at 10gen.com, the filter should be **from:10gen.com**, **skip the inbox**, **apply a label**, and **forward** to a real team member's mailbox.
* It will look something like:
![example it@artsymail.com filter](images/example_gmail_filter.png)
* When possible, unsubscribe the it@artsymail.com from non-essential notifications.
* On a regular basis, any un-handled mail that ends up in the main it@artsymail.com inbox will be reviewed and filtered or unsubscribed (currently by [Joey](https://github.com/joeyAghion)).
