# Engineering Playbook

## Goals of this document

This playbook was inspired by [Thoughtbot's playbook](https://thoughtbot.com/playbook), as well as internal discussions of ways for Artsy's engineering team to share a common vision and hard-won lessons internally. It aims to make good decisions easy, leaving plenty of space for experiments and even radical departures, but improving consistency where helpful. Rather than a set of policies for everyone to conform to, it's here to:
* help refine our own thinking
* create a forum for future discussion and iteration
* establish shared vocabulary
* offer a framework for when it's desired

This is a living document--a perpetual work in progress as we acquire new experiences, struggle through post-mortems, and experiment with new approaches. _You_ are the co-author, so when you're convinced a new tool or practice should be incorporated, submit a PR!


## Working together

### Project Management

Teams at Artsy use a variety of project management processes and tools including:
* [Github issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
* [Zenhub](https://www.zenhub.com/)
* [Trello](https://trello.com/)
* [Geekbot](https://geekbot.io/)
* (Others?)

Teams tend to work in short (1-2 week) _sprints_, with a planning meeting at the start and sometimes a review or retrospective at the end.
