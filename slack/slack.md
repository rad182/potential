# Slack

Get on [Slack](https://artsy.slack.com). You can download the OSX app from the [Apple store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slack/id803453959?mt=12). Also install it on your phone. We use Slack for all internal messaging, and prefer it to email in, basically, all cases.

### Engineering Slack Channels

* [#dev](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/dev): For asking questions to all engineers, or discussing things related to the dev team as a whole.
* [#dev-offtopic](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/dev-offtopic): Random things you want to send to the dev team that are not specifically work-related.
* [#help](https://artsy.slack.com/messages/help): For asking and answering questions.

### Tips and Tricks

* Typing `@channel` in any channel will send a notification to everyone in that channel. Refrain from doing this unless itâ€™s imperative that everyone see your message. You can also `@` people directly in a channel, or direct-message them.
* `/hangout` starts a google hangout in that channel
* Slack uses markdown for styling text.
    - \`\`\````multi-line code```\`\`\`
    - \``single-line code`\`
    - \**italic*\*
    - \*\***bold**\*\*
